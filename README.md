# Edge TPU - Tiny YOLO v3

![Demo](demo.gif)

This repository contains the instructions and scripts to run the Tiny YOLO-v3 on Google's Edge TPU USB Accelerator.

### 1 - Convert darknet .weights to Keras model
The network can be trained using either the original darknet implementation (https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet) or one of its forks (e.g. https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet). 

**Important note:** The Edge TPU does not support the Leaky ReLU function, so it should be replaced by the regular ReLU. (https://coral.ai/docs/edgetpu/models-intro/#supported-operations) 

The darknet weights can be converted to a Keras model using: https://github.com/qqwweee/keras-yolo3. However, this implementation doesn't support the regular ReLU function. Additionally, the TF-Lite conversion later also requires the input shape to be explicit (instead of `None`). So, I've made a fork with the (stupidly simple) required modifications here: https://github.com/guichristmann/keras-yolo3.

    python convert.py tiny-yolo-cfg.cfg darknet-weights.weights keras-filename.h5
    
### 2 - Convert Keras to TF-Lite model with full integer quantization.
To run on Edge TPU, we need to convert the Keras model to TF-Lite and apply post-training full integer quantization. https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_quantization.

    python keras_to_tflite_quant.py keras-model.h5 output-filename.tflite
    
**Note**: The quantization of the `RESIZE_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR` op is only supported in Tensorflow nightly packages as of now, so you need use that for this script. 
    
    pip install tf-nightly
    
### 3 - Compile with Edge TPU compiler
Install the Edge TPU library and compiler: https://coral.ai/docs/edgetpu/compiler/.

Run the compiler on the TF-Lite quantized model:
    
    edgetpu_compiler quantized.tflite

If everyhing is correct you should get a log with every op mapped to Edge TPU:

    Edge TPU Compiler version 2.0.267685300
    Input: quantized.tflite
    Output: quantized_edgetpu.tflite
    Operator                       Count      Status
    RESIZE_NEAREST_NEIGHBOR        1          Mapped to Edge TPU
    MAX_POOL_2D                    6          Mapped to Edge TPU
    CONCATENATION                  1          Mapped to Edge TPU
    QUANTIZE                       4          Mapped to Edge TPU
    CONV_2D                        13         Mapped to Edge TPU
